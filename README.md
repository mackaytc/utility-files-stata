# Utility Files for Stata

This repo contains useful bits of Stata code. Files include examples of how to:
 * Retrive p-values after running `reg` command in Stata using `ttest` and `r(table)`
 * Convert a list / table of dates some event occurs (e.g. legislation is enacted, a policy is implemented, etc.) into a panel-formatted data set
